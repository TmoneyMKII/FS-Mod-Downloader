## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Mod Compatibility

- **Always check game version compatibility** before installing
- FS25 mods won't work in FS22, and vice versa
- Some mods require other mods as dependencies (check mod descriptions)

### Mod Folder Management

- Keep your mods folder organized
- Remove mods you no longer use to reduce load times
- Back up your mods folder before major changes

### Performance Considerations

- Too many mods can slow down your game
- Large maps and high-poly vehicle mods use more resources
- If experiencing issues, try disabling mods one by one
